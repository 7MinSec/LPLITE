# 7MinSec's LPLITE (Live Interactive Training Edition) 

## What is LPLITE?
To quote the course's [landing page](https://7minsec.com/services/training/#lplite):

---

*Light Pentest LITE is a 3-day course, with each class session being 4 hours long.  This training consists of live (via Zoom), hands-on, instructor-led sessions focused on teaching you how to find, exploit and defend against common Active Directory weaknesses!*

*You will be given access to a "real" corporate network and a Windows virtual machine that is pre-loaded with all the tools and scripts you need to be successful during the course.  We will work through a series of objectives together, with the ultimate goal of "owning" the entire enterprise!*

---

## Ok but what's this GitHub repo for?
We are currently working through a round of beta testing for **version 2** of the class, so we wanted to create a space to track and resolve issues that the testers come up against!

## I'm one of your beta testers - what the heck do you expect from me?
I would love you to go through the following tasks and [raise issues](https://github.com/7MinSec/LPLITE/issues) for:

* Any typos/corrections/clarifications in the Teachable curriculum

* Any tools/scripts that are missing in the `C:\users\public\pentest-tools` folder

* Exercises that are not working as advertised

* Any other constructive feedback
