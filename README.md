## What is LPLITE?
To quote the course's [landing page](https://7minsec.com/services/training/#lplite):

---

*Light Pentest LITE is a 3-day course, with each class session being 4 hours long.  This training consists of live (via Zoom), hands-on, instructor-led sessions focused on teaching you how to find, exploit and defend against common Active Directory weaknesses!*

*You will be given access to a "real" corporate network and a Windows virtual machine that is pre-loaded with all the tools and scripts you need to be successful during the course.  We will work through a series of objectives together, with the ultimate goal of "owning" the entire enterprise!*

# What's this repo for?
We are currently working through open [issues](https://github.com/7MinSec/LPLITE/issues) for v2-v3 of the course.  Everything is also heavily under construction as we look to migrate the curriculum from Teachable to CourseStack.
