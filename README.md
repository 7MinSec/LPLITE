## What is LPLITE?
To quote the course's [landing page](https://7minsec.com/services/training/#720ef3d3901ebbd19):

*Light Pentest LITE is a 3-day course, with each class session being 4 hours long.  This training consists of live (via Zoom), hands-on, instructor-led sessions focused on teaching you how to find, exploit and defend against common Active Directory weaknesses!*

*You will be given access to a "real" corporate network and a Kali virtual machine that is pre-loaded with all the tools and scripts you need to be successful during the course.  We will work through a series of objectives together, with the ultimate goal of "owning" the entire [Game of Active Directory](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD) enterprise!*

# What's this repo for?
We are currently working through open [issues](https://github.com/7MinSec/LPLITE/issues) as we build a [GOAD](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD)-flavored version of the course - with the goal of offering it in Q3, 2025.
